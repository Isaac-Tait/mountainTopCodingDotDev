Yea, yea. I know what you're probably thinking - that despite of years of an obvious shift within the dev community away from Javascript to Typescript why did I take so long to make the jump?
Well, what can I say other than I really liked Javascript and I felt like I had SO much more to learn about the language before I could even consider abandoning it for Typescript.

It did become increasingly difficult though to hold fast to Javascript as more and more of the ecosystem has gotten onboard with TS. I was spending a lot of time on ChatGPT asking it to reformat the TS into JS.

So, here I am relaunching (for the fourth or fifth time now) mountainTopCoding(<span role="img" aria-label="mountain with snow-cap">&#127956;</span>); using Typescript.

A few months ago [Josh Comeau](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/) asked his students which course they would most like him to do in 2025. A course on TS was on the list and I voted for it. I love Josh's courses. They are truly phenomenal. If you haven't already, I highly recommend you [check them out](https://www.joshwcomeau.com/).
