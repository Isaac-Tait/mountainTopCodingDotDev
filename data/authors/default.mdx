Greetings and salutations! Welcome to my portfolio, a venue for my web based creations. I am glad
you are here.

My journey to becoming a web developer started on March 12, 2019 when I kicked off my first web
development course on Codecademy.

Since my journey as a web developer began I have had a lot of fun building some cool apps (IMHO) and
created some fun projects. This website is a venue for those endeavors. So, stay for a while, poke
around a bit, or follow me on social media to keep abreast of my future projects and upward
trajectory. Cheers!
